`**NIROG**`

## `**Application**` 
Our application is basically a platform where the users will be able to see all the hospital in there nearby locality.
With the help of this,the users will be able to know what are the `vaccine` that are available in that particular hospital and the `availability range` as well and
they  can get it done as soon as possible.
The users will also get to know all the further services available in that hospital, for example all the new departments , the new services , etc.

## `**WEB PORTAL**`
This is made specifically for the hospitals.
Whenever a particular hospital will register after verification, they can successfully use the portal, where they can customise there information on daily basis and 
update it, for
example :
- New vaccine that are available at present.
- Doctors available at present and all the lastest information along with this.

## Conclusion
As we know there are many people out there, those who dont know regarding the lastest medical facilities given by our government and the guidelines or measures to be 
followed to stay fit and healthy. With the help of this application we are trying to bridge the gap between the hospitals and the common people and make the common 
peoples aware .
