`**NIROG**`

Though India's healthcare is one of the fastest growing in the world,lack of availability is a major concern for the country's tremendous population. Apart from 
accessibility, awareness is a major deterrent to addressing health issues, both in terms of timely and quality care.

By providing all the neccessary informations digitally to everyone, we can avoid the complications to much extend.

# `**Application**` 

Our application is basically a platform where the users will be able to see all the hospital in there nearby locality digitally.
With the help of this,the users will be able to know what are the `vaccine` that are available in that particular hospital and the `availability range` as well and
they  can get it done as soon as possible.
The users will also get to know all the further services available in that particular hospital, for example  the new departments introduced, the new services available, etc.

# `**WEB PORTAL**`

This is made specifically for the hospital authority.
Whenever a particular hospital will register after verification, they can successfully use the portal, where they can customise there information on daily basis and 
update it, for
example :
- New vaccine that are available at present.
- Doctors available at present and all the lastest information along with this.
